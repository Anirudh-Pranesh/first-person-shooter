# First-Person-Shooter
This is one of my best starting attempts at making a first person shooter game. Although there are still a lot of bugs, I am proud of what I have developed. </br>

Run FPS3.exe to play the game. It can be found in FPS3-build

Can't upload the whole zip file for the project because i ran out of LFS data packs. Here is my source scripts for it instead

# Controls : 

WASD for momvement, shift for crouch</br>

Grapple system : Right click to grapple to a wall or ceiling</br>

Shooting : Left click to shoot </br>

Wallrun : Press A or D along with W on a wall</br>

Slow down time : Hold Q to slow down time, and F to go back to normal</br>

# Bugs : 

When going very fast with grapple, you can clip through the wall and go outside</br>

Enemy bots don't shoot projectile properly sometimes</br>

When you die from damage, you will have to restart the whole application</br>

No reload animation</br>

# Future developments : 

Maybe one day I'll pick this project up again. I've wanted to do something related to time, and I already have some basic stuff for it. Game still needs a lot of improvement.

- Better enemy system
- Parkour system
- Implementation of some sort of time travelling concept
- Multiplayer implementation (not guaranteed)
- Wider range of guns
- Removal of currently existing issues
